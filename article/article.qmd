## Introduction

## Literature Review

## Data Description

The data presented in this study comes from the _EUROVOICES General Population Poll (EUGPP)_

<<<<<<<< TABLE WITH DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS OF THE SAMPLE]  >>>>>>>>

## Political Discrimination in the European Union

The EUGPP data set has a dedicated module to explore experiences of discrimination in 110 sub-national regions within the EU. Respondents were presented with a list of 11 grounds—e.g. sex, gender, migration status, ethnicity—and asked if they have experienced any form of discrimination or harassment (D/H) related to those grounds in the past 12 months. The Democracy & Fundamental Rights report from the EUROVOICES project identifies political opinion as the most frequently reason mentioned by respondents in XX out of 110 sub-national regions in the EU. As displayed in @tbl-dicg, political opinion was the most frequently mentioned ground for discrimination in 15 of the 27 member states of the EU.

<<<<<<<< TO TEST >>>>>>>>
Political Opinion might not be the most frequently mentioned ground of discrimination mentioned by vulnerable groups (female, foreigner, minority, dark skin tone) but it is the most frequent in the overall sample because it affects multiple groups (vulnerable and not-vulnerable)
