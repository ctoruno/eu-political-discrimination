The estimation used the matched sample of 14,004 respondents, region fixed effects, demographic and political covariates, and clustered standard errors at the regional level. *, **, and *** represent statistical significance at $p < 0.05$, $p < 0.01$, and $p < 0.001$, respectively. Estimates shown in the table have been transformed using an exponential transformation to interpret them as a percentage change.},
